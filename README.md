## Overview
CreditShield is a machine learning-powered fraud detection system that uses synthetic data and blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and scalability. It monitors real-time transactions in bank accounts, identifies potential fraudulent activity, and provides secure ledger management via blockchain. The system integrates a real-time data stream using Apache Kafka and Ethereum blockchain for secure and decentralized ledgering.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on synthetic data to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Ethereum for secure, decentralized, and scalable ledger management.
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Implements Apache Kafka for real-time transaction processing.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates realistic data for model training.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for interaction.

## Inspiration
BNY's challenge caught our attention because of the rising importance of technology in fraud prevention. Integrating AI and real-time data processing into systems that protect people is essential, and this project aimed to address that.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js
- Apache Kafka
- MongoDB
- Ethereum client (e.g., Geth or Infura)
- Solidity compiler

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noway-code/CreditShield.git
   cd CreditShield
   ```

2. Install the Python and Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Run:

    On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\Activate`

    On Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Start the Ethereum client:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection-etehereum
   npm install
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   ganache-cli --gasPrice 0 --defaultBalanceEther 1000000 --accounts 1000

4. Run the backend and frontend services:

    In a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   touch .env
   ```
    
    Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   NETWORK_URL=http://localhost:8545
   MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your_contract_address>
   ```
   - MongoDB: Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and create a new cluster. Add your IP to the database connections. Get the mongo connection string with username and password add it to the `.env` for <MONGO_URI>.
   - Find ganache-cli, choose any of the private keys and add it to the `.env` for <private_key>.
5. In a new terminal compile and deploy the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run ../scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
    Copy the string in the terminal and add it to the `.env` for <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>.
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```
6. In a new terminal run: ``node fraud-detection-ethereum/scripts/fetch_addresses.js``

7. Run the backend services:
   ```bash
   cd app
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
8. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

After completing the setup:
1. Access the front-end at `http://localhost:5173/`.
2. First train the model by uploading a CSV file with transaction data (use the `transactions.csv` file in the `data` directory).
3. When the model is trained, you can start the real-time data stream by pasting in. You can copy the data from the `client/src/assets/real_time_transactions.csv`file.
4. Verify the blockchain at anytime by running `cd fraud-detection-ethereum/backend` and `node readLedger.js`.

## How We Built It

Our team divided the project into four main components:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, trained on synthetic data generated for fraud detection.
- **Blockchain Integrity**: Implemented Ethereum-based ledgering using Solidity smart contracts to ensure transaction integrity.
- **Real-time Data Stream**: Leveraged Apache Kafka and Zookeeper for real-time transaction streaming.
- **Frontend**: Built using React and TailwindCSS for a responsive and clean user interface.

## Challenges We Faced

One of the major challenges was aligning the different parts of the project, especially since we didn't start with a fully defined plan. Early on, much of the work was done individually, and integrating these pieces was challenging but rewarding.

## Accomplishments

- **Model Accuracy**: We successfully trained a machine learning model that provides accurate fraud predictions while avoiding overfitting.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Created a complex system to generate realistic synthetic data for training the model.
- **Blockchain Ledger**: Deployed a secure and decentralized ledger using Ethereum smart contracts.

## What We Learned

Key takeaways include:
- The importance of clear planning and communication.
- Hands-on experience with machine learning and synthetic data generation.
- Introduction to real-time data processing using Apache Kafka.
- Gained experience with blockchain and Solidity smart contract development.

## Future Plans
We are proud of what we achieved during the development of CreditShield. While there are no immediate plans for further work, weâ€™re excited to continue exploring the concepts and technologies we worked with, especially in future projects.
